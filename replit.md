## System Architecture
The application is built with Vue.js 3 (Options API), Vuex for state management, Vue Router, and Axios for HTTP requests. It utilizes a custom "Native Journey" design system for a modern and consistent UI/UX, characterized by a specific color palette (Primary Teal #0D9488, Terracotta #E07856, Amber #F59E0B), typography, spacing, border-radius, and shadows. All UI components are designed to be 100% compliant with this system, ensuring responsiveness across all breakpoints.

**Key Architectural Decisions & Features:**
- **Dynamic Branding:** Header fetches tour operator logo and company name from an API endpoint with a fallback.
- **Progressive Step Navigation:** Features a multi-step booking process with dynamic and contiguous step IDs that adapt to booking type (single vs. combo) and add-on availability.
- **Combination Packages Support:** Fully supports multi-package bookings, including dedicated "MyTrip" and "Maps" pages for visualizing itineraries.
- **Modular Add-ons System:** A refactored add-ons system with 6 distinct input components, comprehensive validation (including parent/child relationships and conditional visibility), real-time pricing calculation (one-time, per-unit, per-pax fees), and persistence of selections.
- **Real-time Pricing:** Pricing breakdowns for tours and add-ons update immediately upon user selections.
- **Responsive Design:** Auto-fill responsive grids for tour browsing, 3-column layouts for scheduling, and mobile optimizations across all pages.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Custom calendar, booking summary badges, redesigned confirmation page with animated success states, and enhanced icon visibility.
- **API Integration:** Connects to an external, multi-tenant backend API, with dynamic baseURL configuration via Axios interceptors.

## External Dependencies
- **Stripe**: For secure payment processing (`VUE_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`).
